# aave-carbon-footprint
Calculate the carbon footprint of your protocol contracts before the merge! 

The carbon footprint is calculated by getting the gas used by each transaction and multiply it by a factor that takes into consideration the energy mix and geographic location of Ethereum mining pools, plus the time at which your transaction took place. 
You can calculate the carbon footprint of your own Ethereum wallet here : https://carbon.fyi/

Happy merge!
